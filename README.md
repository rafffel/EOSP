# EOSP

Extensible Open Source Plotter

A plotter for small or large vinyl roll DIY mostly printed part
Using forked Marlin with Arduino 2560 + Ramps 1.4

Anyone is free to contribute for make it better stronger faster

#Printed Parts
STL folder Contains all files to be printed.
The final X on name is for number of copy you need
Variable mean is depend of the length you wan't for you're plotter.

The variable part is Y Roll Parts
	On pro plotter there is 4 roll for 1m37
	On my 30 cm version i Put 3 on each 2020 Aluminium profile tube

Same For Y_Grid_Bar_Support this part is for prevent the 8mm bar flex

There is missing X endstop STL mainly because i don't use endstop for moment
Free to draw it if it wasn't done.
##I print all stl at 25% infill

# BOM

-PLA or ABS 
-Flex filament (my roll are made in 90A durometer and it's seem ok)
-MGN 12H Linear rail (length depend of the working size you want) you need 2 carriage one for X and one for Z 12C type can Work but fixation of X carriage need to be rework
-1 GT2 Belt Depend of Worksize 
-1 GT2 pulley
-3 Nema 17 (i Took High torque)
-1 Servo 9G SG90 
-2 5x8 coupler
-6 608zz Bearing
-2 F625ZZ per Y pressure roll (for my 30cm i need 12 for 6 Rolls)
-2 F625ZZ for X tensionner (625zz will do the job too)
-4 2020 Aluminium Bar length depend of you're working size (i will done the calculation from worksize later)
-2 8mm Rod length depend of you're working size (i will done the calculation from worksize later)
-M3 and M4 screw and nuts / T-nuts and washer (i will precise number and size later)
-Nails Diam 3mm x 70mm (2 for pressure system and 2 for closing system)
-Hard small spring
-Maybe something i don't have in mind
